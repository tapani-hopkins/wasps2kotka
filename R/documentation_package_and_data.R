#' @details 
#' Typical usage is one of the following:
#' * Write down the sample which wasps came from, and create an upload file for the wasps with [make_upload()]. 
#' * Write down the wasp labels, then use [make_upload()] to extract data from the labels and create an upload file for the wasps.  
#' 
#' Before using, you will need to load the label texts or sample identifiers to R. Typically this will be by reading a text file, or a csv file you've exported from Excel.  
#' 
#' After you've got the upload file, you'll need to add any missing fields. It is also worth checking if any problems occurred: the script highlights any incorrect sample identifiers or date mismatches between labels and samples.

#' Example labels of wasps from Peru and Ecuador
#'
#' Labels of Amazonian wasps collected in Peru and Ecuador. These give a good example of what kind of labels there are: Ecuadorian canopy fogging labels, Peruvian labels from 1998-2011, quite a few mistypes, mistakes etc.. These are real labels of Banchinae wasps.

#' Malaise samples collected in Peru, Uganda and elsewhere (overview)
#'
#' An abbreviated version of the `m_kotka` dataset. Contains basic data on what Malaise samples were collected in e.g. Peru and Uganda, including how the samples might be written on labels. Used by the script to e.g. recognise sample IDs from labels.

#' Malaise samples collected in Peru, Uganda and elsewhere (Kotka format)
#'
#' Data on the Malaise samples collected in e.g. Peru and Uganda, in the format Kotka uses. Contains almost everything that is in Kotka (some irrelevant columns may have been omitted). Used by the script to get the collecting dates, coordinates etc data for wasps caught in these samples.
#'
#' This file has been downloaded from the Kotka Collection Management System in Excel format. If a new version is ever needed:
#' - download from Kotka
#' - remove second header row
#' - convert to csv
#' - read in to R keeping the column names intact, e.g. `read.csv(file, colClasses="character", check.names=F)`
