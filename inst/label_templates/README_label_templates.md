# wasps2kotka

Folder "label_templates" contains templates for printing labels for the uploaded wasps. These are used in the Generic Labels tool of [Kotka](https://kotka.luomus.fi/).

To use, search for the wasps you want to label, then open the Generic Labels tool (or click on the "Labels" button when uploading wasps). Load one of the templates. Your labels should then be ready to download as PDF and print (two-sided) on 160g / cm3 A4 cardboard.
